# Project Dr.Care

Dr.Care is a Health Care Management System (HMS) which is designed to help doctors monitor and manage their clinical operations such as patient records, reports, and generating prescriptions for health journeys. The system aims to provide easy access to patient information, ensuring security and privacy. The system also includes profile management, creating patient profiles with IDs, and data management for the insertion of patient health records and reports. The HMS aims to improve healthcare provider efficiency by ensuring the availability of accurate patient information. It will help healthcare providers carry out their responsibilities more successfully, make wise decisions, and prioritize patient care. Dr.Care is expected to transform the healthcare industry by prioritizing the effectiveness of healthcare professionals and ensuring the availability of accurate patient information.

## Introduction

In today’s world rapidly involving information technology in every industry, there is massive growth in the healthcare industry. This proposal outlines the growth of the healthcare management system that solely focuses on enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of healthcare providers of doctor's clinical services. Having a platform
in place that will help centralized clinical operations such as a separate profile for each patient, viewing the past records of the patient, inserting new health records, updating current health status, and deleting the past records and reports, can generate prescriptions (it is generated into a template after filling in the blanks) this
health care platform/system is an all-in-one that provides extra solutions including inventory, bills and to maintain the security and the privacy of the patient information by implementing separate patient numbers and generate an ID card for each patient with an RFID that’s the IoT part which is being developed. Enhancing these facilities lifts the weight of healthcare all over clinical operations and makes it more digitalized and automated. Imagining this healthcare platform benefits both parties' doctor can ensure that their medical history and comprehensive view of the medication journey.

## Features & Functions

Key Features and Functions of the project is listed below.

- Doctor Profile 
- Patient Profile Creation 
- Records Add / Remove Function 
- Health Status of the Patient 
- Prescription System 
- View Past Records 
- Search Function 

### Features & Functions Explained

First, you must register as a doctor. Once you get the administrative privileges as a doctor, you can search for patient’s profile using the name or the RFID Card Number. If the patient profile does not exist, you can create a new separate profile for a patient and add their medical records and reports. Then you can update the health status of a patient in the same profile according to the on-going disease/illness. Upon identifying a patient’s disease / illness, doctor can issue a prescription regarding the medicines that the patient should take within the same system. Doctor will get a normal form to fill as the prescription. Upon creating the prescription and saving it, the system will automatically generate the details that are included in the form into an in-built prescription template. After that doctor will be
provided with the opportunity to take a printout or send the prescription to a patient via email. All the details are stored in our database, due to that a doctor can look up to a patient’s past medical records and prescriptions whenever they want.
